New (simpler) pretty-printing engine. The representation of documents in
memory is slightly larger; document construction is perhaps slightly slower,
while rendering is significantly faster. (Construction dominates rendering.)
The rendering speed is now guaranteed to be independent of the width
parameter. The price to pay for this simplification is that the primitive
document constructors [column] and [nesting] are no longer supported. The
API is otherwise unchanged.
